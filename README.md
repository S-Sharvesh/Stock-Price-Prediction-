# Stock-Price-Prediction

# Project Description: Advanced Machine Learning Models for Time Series Forecasting of Stock Prices

In this project, I implemented and trained a variety of sophisticated machine learning models to predict stock prices with high accuracy. The models I worked with include:

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting): A powerful ensemble learning method known for its robustness and efficiency in handling large datasets and complex patterns.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks): A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to capture temporal dependencies in time series data, making it highly effective for sequential data.
WGAN-GP (Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty): An advanced GAN architecture aimed at generating realistic synthetic data by learning the underlying distribution of stock prices.
Data Preprocessing Pipelines

To ensure the models performed optimally, I developed comprehensive data preprocessing pipelines, which included:

Normalization: Standardizing the data to ensure all features have the same scale, which is crucial for the convergence of gradient-based algorithms.
Dataset Splitting: Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance accurately and prevent overfitting.
Feature Engineering with Fourier Transforms: Extracting meaningful features from the time series data using Fourier transforms, which helped in capturing periodic patterns and trends, thereby enhancing the model's predictive power.
Hyperparameter Optimization

To maximize the performance of the models, I employed rigorous hyperparameter optimization techniques:

GridSearchCV for XGBoost: A systematic approach to find the best combination of hyperparameters by exhaustively searching through a specified parameter grid.
Custom Training Loops for GAN Models: Tailored training procedures for the GAN models, including specific strategies for adjusting learning rates, optimizing the generator and discriminator alternately, and incorporating gradient penalties to stabilize training.
Model Evaluation and Visualization

The evaluation of model predictions was carried out through detailed plots and comprehensive metrics, including:

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): A standard metric for measuring the accuracy of predictions by comparing the predicted values with the actual stock prices.
Detailed Plots: Visualization of model predictions against actual stock prices over time, which provided clear insights into the models' performance and reliability.
By implementing these advanced machine learning models and robust preprocessing and evaluation techniques, I achieved significant improvements in the accuracy and reliability of stock price forecasts. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in financial time series forecasting and provides a solid foundation for further enhancements and applications in the field.
